        Minneapolis prides itself on having many means of transport all around the city and the surrounding suburbs. In
        downtown everything is in walking distance and during our cold Minnesota winters feel free to take advantage of
        our extensive skyway system. Just in the past few years we have created a light rail system that will take you
        to St. Paul, Mall of America and many of the larger suburbs. In the summer Minneapolis also provides bikes and
        scooters for quick and enviromentally friendly options of getting around the city.
